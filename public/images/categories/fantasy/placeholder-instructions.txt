PLACEHOLDER IMAGE CREATION INSTRUCTIONS

If you don't have images ready yet, you can create simple placeholder images to test the layout:

Option 1: Use an online placeholder service
--------------------------------------------
You can use services like:
- https://placeholder.com/
- https://placehold.co/
- https://placekitten.com/

Example URLs:
- Main category image (1200x675): https://placehold.co/1200x675/9333ea/ffffff?text=Fantasy
- Space Ranger (800x450): https://placehold.co/800x450/3b82f6/ffffff?text=Space+Ranger
- Dwarf Ranger (800x450): https://placehold.co/800x450/ef4444/ffffff?text=Dwarf+Ranger
- Elven Ranger (800x450): https://placehold.co/800x450/22c55e/ffffff?text=Elven+Ranger
- Halfling Ranger (800x450): https://placehold.co/800x450/f59e0b/ffffff?text=Halfling+Ranger
- Chaos Dwarf City (800x450): https://placehold.co/800x450/64748b/ffffff?text=Chaos+Dwarf+City

Simply visit these URLs in your browser, save the images, and place them in the appropriate folders.

Option 2: Create your own placeholder images
--------------------------------------------
1. Use any image editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, etc.)
2. Create a new image with the recommended dimensions
3. Add a colored background
4. Add text with the name of the category/generator
5. Save as JPG or PNG in the appropriate folder

Option 3: Use AI image generators
---------------------------------
You can use AI image generators like:
- DALL-E
- Midjourney
- Stable Diffusion

Example prompts:
- Fantasy: "A magical fantasy landscape with castles and dragons, digital art style"
- Space Ranger: "A futuristic space ranger in armor with cosmic background, digital art"
- Dwarf Ranger: "A sturdy dwarf ranger with axe in mountainous terrain, fantasy art"
- Elven Ranger: "An elegant elven ranger with bow in a mystical forest, fantasy art"
- Halfling Ranger: "A nimble halfling scout in natural surroundings, fantasy art"
- Chaos Dwarf City: "A dark, imposing chaos dwarf city with industrial elements and fire, fantasy art"

Remember to resize the generated images to the recommended dimensions before saving them.
